#  ‚öΩ Breakout Game

This project is a classic **Breakout** game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The objective is to break all the bricks using a ball without losing all your lives.

## üé≤ How to Play

- Move the paddle left or right to bounce the ball and break the bricks.
- Clear all the bricks to win the game.
- The game ends when you lose all your lives.

### üéÆ Controls
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move paddle right
- **Mouse Movement**: Move the paddle based on mouse position.

## üöÄ Features

- **Bricks and Collision Detection**: The game features multiple rows and columns of bricks. When the ball collides with a brick, the brick disappears and the score increases.
- **Score and Lives**: The score is displayed on the canvas. You start with 3 lives, and each time the ball passes the paddle, you lose a life.
- **Win Condition**: Break all bricks to win the game. If the ball misses the paddle three times, the game is over.
